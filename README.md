# üö¶ Traffic Junction Simulator

Welcome to the **Traffic Junction Simulator** for **COMP202: Data Structures and Algorithms** (Jan 2025). This project simulates a traffic intersection with four roads (A, B, C, D), each with three lanes, using queue-based vehicle management and SDL2 for visualization. üöó


## üåü Project Overview

This simulator manages traffic at a junction with 12 lanes (A1-A3, B1-B3, C1-C3, D1-D3), handling:
- **Normal Condition**: Serves lanes based on vehicle count.
- **High-Priority Condition**: Prioritizes lane A2 when it has >10 vehicles, until <5.
- **Emergency Condition**: Serves any lane with >15 vehicles immediately.
- **Visualization**: Displays roads, vehicles, and traffic lights with animations.


The system uses file-based communication (`vehicles.data`) between the simulator and a vehicle generator, with thread-safe queue processing.

## üìã Features

- **Queue Management**:
  - 12 vehicle queues (one per lane).
  - Priority queue for lane scheduling, with A2 prioritized at >10 vehicles.
- **Traffic Logic**:
  - Normal: Highest vehicle count lane served.
  - High-Priority: A2 served first if >10 vehicles.
  - Emergency: Immediate service for lanes with >15 vehicles.
  - One lane green at a time to avoid deadlock.
- **GUI**: SDL2-based visualization with animated lights and vehicle movement.
- **Multithreading**: Separate threads for GUI rendering, queue processing, and file reading.
- **Logging**: Console output for vehicle additions, dequeues, and queue status.
